 # Health Insurance Website
 
We develop a user friendly health insurance web application “Swasthya Suraksha”  for rural India, that enables them to select a Health insurance plan according to their price requirements and upload the necessary documents thereby digitalizing the whole process. This application also enables the local Health Insurance Companies to post their plans, keep track of customer information and carry out the entire process digitally.
